# DevScripts
> Scripts to initialize a new server with user "Dev"

1. To start simply run init.sh with sudo using `sudo ./init.sh`
2. After it's done start byobu and run mongo 
```bash
  byobu #to start byobu
  sudo mongod #to start mongo db
  #Then press F6 to deattach from byobu
``` 
3. What's left now is to start the second script with `./start.sh`
